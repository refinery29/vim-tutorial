Refinery29's Getting Started with VIM
============================

*Made for a tech talk on 05/08/2014*

This is a tutorial that barely covers the surface of the true power of
vim. It was made as a way to assist the workshop, but also as a "do it
yourself" tutorial that the attendees, or anyone for that matter, could
take home and play with.

Disclaimer
----------
This isn't meant to be the ultimate guide of vim, replace vimtutor (by
the way, try vimtutor), or turn anyone into a vim guru. This tutorial
has two goals:

- give those who haven't seen it  a decent level of comfort in about an hour;
- serve as future quick reference for the most used features.

Setup
-----
The most annoying thing in vim is typing with CAPS LOCK on. Let's make caps lock a useful modifer key.
System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys... -> Set the caps lock to be a CTRL key, these are super useful in vim

Use vim!
--------
To begin, run this command to get set up:
```sh
$ curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refinery29/vim-tutorial/master/install.sh | sh
```
