Let's talk vim, Ã  la modes!

There are 3 modes that really matter to us.

* Normal Mode (Command mode)
This mode allows the user to perform buffered commands. Like we were doing in the previous example.
example: (j,k,b,w,a,g)

From any other mode, press <esc> and you'll get back to Normal mode.

How do I know I'm in this mode?
- The bottom of the screen will say "Normal"
- You can't input text normally
- By default, vim starts in Normal mode, when you start up vim you're in Normal mode

* Insert Mode
This is the mode where vim actually behaves like an editor.

From Normal mode, press `i` to get into Insert mode.

How do I know I'm in this mode?
- The bottom of the screen will say "Insert"
- Thank my deity I CAN TYPE AGAIN!!!
- Keystrokes will insert characters where I want them to.

* Visual Mode
"Visual selection mode", see what is being selected.

From Normal mode, press `v` for Visual mode.

How do I know I'm in this mode?
- The bottom of the screen will say "Visual"
- As the arrow keys are used the selection follows along
- There are additional commands that can only be used when in this mode

REMEMBER: to quit and save this file, <esc> ZZ <enter>
