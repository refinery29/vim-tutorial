Help! This file is a mess!

In normal mode we have buffer commands. They are called as such because they can be one or more characters.

â€¢ Remove the spelling mistakes in the following using the `x` command:
First we make sure we're in normal mode.
Move the cursor over the offending characters (using `h`,`j`,`k`,`l`)
Press `x` over each incorrect character.

1. I love vi3m s0o muxxxxch!
2. Aren't theeeese waffles the3 best?

Buffered commands are repeatable by using a number before the command. Fix the string below by using `4 x`

1. Pattyyyyy is so silly sometimes.
2. Axxxxxel needs a hug.

Think of it as saying "repeat four times: delete"

Remember how to quit this file without saving it?
