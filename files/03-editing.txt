Buffer commands are available from Normal.
They are called buffer commands because some of them need
more than one key to be pressed in sequence.

â€¢ Remove the spelling mistakes in the following using the `x` command:
  First we make sure we're in normal mode.
  Move the cursor over the offending characters (using `h`,`j`,`k`,`l`)
  Press `x` over each incorrect character.

1. I love vi3m s0o muxxxxch!
2. Aren't theeeese waffles the3 best?

Buffered commands are repeatable by using a number before the command. Fix the string below by using `4 x`

1. Pattyyyyy is so silly sometimes.
2. Axxxxxel needs a hug.

Think of it as saying "repeat four times: delete"
