Yes! Vim has a command line. Think of bash (terminal) in the editor.

For all these buffered commands we've been using there is
another way in vim to invoke it.

To get to the command line,
go to Normal mode with `<Esc>`, then press `:`.

The cursor will move to the bottom of the screen, and the last line
will start with a ":". You may then write the command, and finally
enter it with the `<Enter>` key.

Try the following commands (remember to press `<Esc>` for *Normal*).

- `<Esc>:set number<Enter>`
- `<Esc>:set nonumber<Enter>`

The first command tells vim to show line numbers. This command can be
used in the .vimrc (without the leading `:`) to the same effect.

The second command reverts the previous change.

vim has autocomplete! just use the <tab> key

Speaking of tabs...
vim has tabs, let's edit our vimrc file in a new tab

- `<Esc>:tabe<tab> ../vimrc<tab>`

To close this file let's use the command line

- `<Esc>:q` Read as "Quit please"

If it complains about the file being modified

- `<Esc>:q!` Read as "Quit dammit"

If you want to save your file and quit

- `<Esc>:wq` Read as "Write and Quit"
